# QR Code reader project
This mini project aims to show how to extract the qr code from any given image regardless of where the code is on a given image. QR codes are useful in many everyday situations and being able to scan for one easily and efficiently can be of great importance.

 
### A short list about the packages that you'll need for run the code
1. Python = version 3.9
2. openCV = version 4.5.5
3. Numpy = version 1.22
4. Matplotlib = version 3.5

### Instruction how to run it
1. Open qr_code.ipynb file - I suggest to use Visual Studio Code
2. In the second cell you can edit the image, for the example I used "qr.png"
3. I've tried two different ways to get the same results, in the image below I've highlighted the text that you can edit and the thickness, I'd suggest at least 3

4. Run all the file to see the result
