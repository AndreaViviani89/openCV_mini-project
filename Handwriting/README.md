# Handwriting project
This mini project shows how to extract the individual numbers from an image. The extracted numbers are then used as inputs in prediction models for handwritten recognition
 
### A short list about the packages that you'll need for run the code
1. Python = version 3.9
2. openCV = version 4.5.5
3. Numpy = version 1.22
4. Matplotlib = version 3.5
5. Torch - version 1.12

### Instruction how to run it

1. Open handwriting.ipynb file - I suggest to use Visual Studio Code
2. In the second cell you can edit the image, for the example I used "3.png"
3. In this file I followed these steps:
   1. Preprocess the image
   2. Set the final visualization
   3. Load the model
   4. Predict the output
5. Run all the file to see the result
