# Handwriting project
This mini project shows how to extract the individual numbers from an image. The extracted numbers are then used as inputs in prediction models for handwritten recognition
 
### A short list about the packages that you'll need for run the code
1. Python = version 3.9
2. openCV = version 4.5.5
3. Numpy = version 1.22
4. Matplotlib = version 3.5

### Instruction how to run it

1. Open im_annotation.ipynb file - I suggest to use Visual Studio Code
2. In the second cell you can edit the image, for the example I used "venice.png"
3. In the forth cell there are the annotation, with the sample image I annotate "gondola" and "building"
4. Run all the file to see the result
