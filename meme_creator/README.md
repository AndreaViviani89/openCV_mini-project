# Meme generator project
This mini project takes an image and text to write on the image and returns an image with the written text on it.
 
### A short list about the packages that you'll need for run the code
1. Python = version 3.9
2. openCV = version 4.5.5
3. Matplotlib = version 3.5

### Instruction how to run it
1. Open meme.ipynb file - I suggest to use Visual Studio Code
2. In the second cell you can edit the image, for the example I used "il-signore-degli-anelli.jpg"
3. In the forth cell you can add the text that you want, with the sample image I wrote "ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY" and "DRINK CAPPUCCINO AFTER 11". In order to obtain the black contourn, I repeat the same sentence increasing the thickness in the black one
